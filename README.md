# microcystis-virus

This is a repository for hosting analysis of Microcystis phage genomics. This research is divided into three main modules. 

## Erie-CRISPR
This analysis is aimed at understanding interactions between *Microcystis* and its phage in Lake Erie's 2014 toxic CHAB by exploiting information from the CRISPR-Cas system.  


## inland-lake
This analysis is aimed at learning more about interactions between *Microcystis* and its phage by using the set of 47 isolate cultures
obtained from 14 inland Michigan lakes spanning a trophic gradient.



## lmm01-analysis
This analysis is aimed at mapping reads from all available and relevant datasets to previously isolated, complete Microcystis phage genomes. Currently, there are two such genomes: lmm01 and MaMV. Therefore, the title of this module is a bit misleading and should probably be changed eventually.
